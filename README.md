**DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM** 
* Data structure
  * How computer organise and store data
  * Each data structure has strength and weakness
  
* Algorithms:
  * Algorithms are steps we take in order to achieve a specific task.
  
There are no best data structure, its always "depends"  on the task or the application.


**BIG O NOTATION [O(?)]**
* According to https://rob-bell.net:
  * Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
